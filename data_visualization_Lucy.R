#It is customary to check for heteroscedasticity of residuals once you build the linear regression model. 
#The reason is, we want to check if the model thus built is unable to explain some pattern in the response variable (Y), 
#that eventually shows up in the residuals. 
#This would result in an inefficient and unstable regression model that could yield bizarre predictions later on.

#The plots we are interested in are at the top-left and bottom-left. 
#The top-left is the chart of residuals vs fitted values, 
#while in the bottom-left one, it is standardised residuals on Y axis. If there is absolutely no heteroscedastity, 
#you should see a completely random, equal distribution of points throughout the range of X axis and a flat red line.

  #This tests for the linear model assumptions and helpfully provides information on other assumptions. 
  #In this case we are going to look at the heteroskedasticity decisions, 
  #which has been identified as not being satisfied. 
  #We therefore reject the null hypothesis and state that there is heteroskedasticity 
  #in this model at the 5% significance level.
